# Drug Review Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze sentiment in drug reviews using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system processes drug review datasets, preprocesses text data, and constructs sentiment classification models to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) associated with each review.

## Overview

The proposed system encompasses a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis in drug reviews. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling using both deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) and machine learning (LightGBM) algorithms. Additionally, sentiment analysis tools such as TextBlob and the Harvard emotional dictionary are leveraged for deeper insights. The system provides a robust framework for extracting and interpreting sentiment from drug reviews effectively.
